# What is this
This project consists of a robotic arm made using 3D components, which chooses which drink to choose from the input of a user through the screen, also through a camera it recognizes which bottle the user has chosen in order to complete their task.

# Description
The arm is capable of picking up a glass, which will stretch into the dispensers position and allow the glass to be filled with the chosen beverage.

1. Grab an empty cup
2. Using a screen choose the drink
3. Moves the cup towards the chosen drink using computer vision
4. The cup glass is taken
